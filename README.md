👋 Hej – I'm **Taylor (he/him)** – I'm a backend & frontend developer and a railway enthusiast with always one idea in mind ('build something that works.'). I'm interested in developing anything interactive, especially around making public transport data from Irish Rail (etc.) more effective and usable in many different ways possible.

I tend to work on lots and lots of random projects that involve a website, database or that even uses Discord.js; most of the time it's a website.
